Alura V1.03 & Zoe V1.06 Source Code Readme
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

Just a few notes when taking a look at the code:


1. Compiler
-----------
Alura and Zoe were written and compiled under MS Visual C++ 6,
and now converted to MS Visual C++ .NET.

I have no idea if you will be able to compile it on other
compilers without errors.


2. ZLIB
-------
To be able to compile Alura and/or Zoe, you will need ZLIB.
You can download ZLIB freely under http://www.zlib.net

Alura and Zoe were compiled with ZLIB Version 1.1.4,
however, there shouldn't be any problems with newer releases.


3. Source Code Structure
------------------------
Please do not mail me telling me that my programming style is
crappy... Alura & Zoe was one of my first C/C++ projects I ever
wrote... :P


4. Final blabla
---------------
As always, you use the source codes at your own risk.
The author (Alhexx) can not be hold responsible for any damage
that might appear to whatever...

Well then, happy Source-Code-Reading....
